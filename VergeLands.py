'''
This simulation focuses on this central question: If you’ve drawn at least one Verge land by Turn T,
then what is the probability that you’ve also drawn a corresponding basic-type land by that turn?

CLARIFICATION 1: Why did I choose to focus on this conditional probability?
I found the probability I determined interesting for several reasons:
•	I condition on drawing a Verge land because I don't care whether or not I drew a basic-type land if I don’t have a Verge land.
	The presence of a Verge land effectively reduces the number of draws that could produce a basic-type land.
•	I take into account mulligans because you would never keep 1 Verge land and 6 spells in practice.
	Nor would you keep 2 Verge land and 5 basic lands.
	Including these hands would skew the probabilities in a way that wouldn’t match reality.
•	I focused on turns 2, 3, and 4 because that's often the turn where you need the secondary color of mana.

CLARIFICATION 2: How are London mulligans handled?
•	A 7-card hand is kept if it has 2, 3, 4, or 5 lands. It is mulliganed otherwise.
•	For a mulligan to 6, we first choose what to put on the bottom and decide keep or mull afterwards.
	To get a good mix, we bottom a spell if we drew 4+ spells and we bottom a land if we drew 4+ lands.
	Afterwards, we keep if we hold 2, 3, or 4 lands. Otherwise, we mulligan.
•	When bottoming lands, we might choose between Verge lands, basics, and other lands.
	We always keep one Verge land if possible and bottom any other Verge lands as much as needed.
	Next, we bottom as many other lands as needed. Finally, we bottom basics as needed.
	This also applies to 5-card and 4-card hands.
•	For a mulligan to 5, we try to get close to 3 lands and 2 spells.
	So we bottom two spells if we drew 4+ spells, we bottom a spell and a land if we drew 3 spells, and we bottom two lands if we drew 2 spells.
	Afterwards, we keep if we have 2, 3, or 4 lands; otherwise, we mulligan.
•	For a mulligan to 4, we try to get close to 3 lands and 1 spell. Then we always keep.
